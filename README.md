# 🧠 Loan Status Prediction System

This project predicts whether a loan will be approved based on applicant details using a Support Vector Machine (SVM) model. The goal is to automate loan decision-making with high accuracy.

🔗 **Live App**: [Click here to try it out]👉(https://loan-status-prediction-system.streamlit.app/)

## 🚀 Features

- Predicts loan approval using SVM
- ~85% accuracy on test data
- Clean data preprocessing pipeline
- Confusion matrix and accuracy score output
- Interactive UI using Streamlit

---

## 📌 Problem Statement

Manual review of loan applications is slow and prone to human error. This ML-based system helps financial institutions automate decisions efficiently by predicting outcomes based on applicant data.
