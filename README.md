# 🧠 Loan Status Prediction System

A machine learning project that predicts whether a loan application will be approved or not based on applicant data. The system uses a Support Vector Machine (SVM) model trained on a real-world dataset.

---

## 🚀 Features

- Predicts loan approval using Support Vector Machine (SVM)
- Over 85% accuracy on evaluation data
- Simple and clean data preprocessing
- Confusion matrix and accuracy display

---

## 📌 Problem Statement

Financial institutions receive many loan applications daily. Manual verification is time-consuming and prone to human error. This ML-based system helps automate loan approval decisions based on applicant information.
